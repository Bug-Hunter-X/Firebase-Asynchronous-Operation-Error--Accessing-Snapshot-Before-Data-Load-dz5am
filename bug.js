The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the data has fully loaded. This is particularly common when using asynchronous operations.  For example:

```javascript
db.collection('myCollection').doc('myDoc').get().then(doc => {
  console.log(doc.data().myField); // Error if data is not yet loaded
});
```
This could lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or incorrect data display.
